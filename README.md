# DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN ADAS SYSTEM FOR THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

Intended to improve safety in transport systems, the concept of driving assistance aims to create a "smart car" capable of providing advice to the user on the conduct to be adopted, to warn him any risk of accident, or even take initiatives to avoid an impending accident, through the use of sensors that allow him to perceive his environment, to test his own condition and that of his driver. The smart car needs sensors of various types to provide the dashboard with enough information to perform different tasks.
The Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) aim to bring intelligence to the vehicle by equipping it with a set of exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors.
The project consists of designing and implementing an ADAS solution that contains three main features, which are Driver Sleepiness Detection, Intelligent Parking and Eye Guided Automotive Lighting. The system is connected to an interactive dashboard based on CAN bus. The idea is to use the CAN bus technology to collect information from different sensors and to control different devices of different ADAS system functions.
